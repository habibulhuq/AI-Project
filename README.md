# AI-Project
This project develops a movie/show rating prediction system that solves if the runtime of a movie/show really affects its imdb_score. 
We will be using the imdb_movies_shows.csv which shows information about a specific movies or shows on Netflix such as release_year, genre, runtime, imdb_score, imdb_votes, etc.

Our hypothesis: If the runtime is very low then score will also be low.  If the runtime is average then the score will be high and if the runtime is high then the score would be low.  

Why? Movie Producers will know how long they should make their movies to help boost itâ€™s IMDb score.
